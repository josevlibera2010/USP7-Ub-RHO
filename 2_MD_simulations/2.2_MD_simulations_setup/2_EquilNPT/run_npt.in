  ntb=2,                                 !2 constant pressure (periodic boundaries are imposed on the system during the calculation of non-bonded interactions.)
  ntp=1,                                 !Flag for constant pressure dynamics, barostat=1 (as default is Berendsen). 1 md with isotropic position scaling

  cut=10                                 !This is used to specify the nonbonded cutoff, in Angstroms. For PME, the cutoff is used to limit direct space sum, and 8.0 is usually a good value.
